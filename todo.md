1. Figure out how to make mas work given it's latest 4.0.0 release
2. Add hot sauce (alfred, ia writer vault settings)
3. Create a custom zsh shell thingy and add it here as well
4. Fix system python fuckery happening locally, see what needs to be updated here
5. Write a cron job so it runs monthly
6. Add to the script a part where it checks all currently installed brews, casks, apps, and global packages and asks if we want to add any of those to this list

From a few years ago:
1. How do I get apps to use settings files I've stored on other platforms like iCloud and Dropbox during setup?
2. How do I copy over setting files for local terminal changes, such as my global gitignore and my bash profile?
