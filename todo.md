1. Figure out how to make mas work given it's latest 4.0.0 release 
2. Use pnpm instead of npm in the global package installation
3. Add hot sauce (alfred, ia writer vault settings)
4. create a custom zsh shell thingy and add it here as well
5. fix system python fuckery happening locally, see what needs to be updated here
6. write a cron job so it runs monthly 
7. Add to the script a part where it checks all currently installed brews, casks, apps, and global packages and asks if we want to add any of those to this list

From a few years ago:
1. How do I get apps to use settings files I've stored on other platforms like iCloud and Dropbox during setup?
2. How do I copy over setting files for local terminal changes, such as my global gitignore and my bash profile?
